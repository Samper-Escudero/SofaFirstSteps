def createScene(rootNode):
# createScene defines the root of the scene hierarchy --> entry point to fill the simulation's content
# This function contains the scene's description. A scene is an ordered tree of nodes, representing objects
# The main node is called rootNode which can contain additional components that describe its behaviour
    MainHeader(rootNode, gravity=[0.0, -9.81, 0.0]) #defines main forces acting on the objects
    ContactHeader(rootNode, alarmDistance=15,contactDistance=1)  #defines how to handle contacts between objects
    #these two behaviours apply to all objects given that they are defined in the scene creation workflow

    #instatiation of two prefab objects:
